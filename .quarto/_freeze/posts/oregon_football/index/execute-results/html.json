I can't even remember the last time I watched an NFL game. However, I do sort of follow college football. And being from Oregon, I root for whatever team from Oregon is playing. Sorry Beaver fans, but for quite a few years the Ducks have given me more to root for. The departure of Oregon's head coach Mario Cristobal at the end of the 2021 season... Well, almost the end. He bolted before Oregon's bowl game. Anyway, the whole season got me thinking about changes in college football over the years. It seemed like there were a lot of coaches that moved around. It also seemed like there were a lot more players that entered the transfer portal. Well, time to get some data and find some answers.\n\nAfter some poking around, I found what looked like a great source for college football data at <http://collegefootballdata.com>. The offer a free API, too, which piqued my interest. I haven't done anything with an API since grad school, so this was a good opportunity to re-learn forgotten skills. So. What to look into first?\n\n## Oregon's Quarterback\n\nQuite a few fans were not happy with Oregon's starting quarterback, Anthony Brown. See [this article](https://duckswire.usatoday.com/2021/10/16/ab-is-our-guy-hes-our-leader-oregon-offense-stands-up-for-qb-anthony-brown-while-boos-rain-down-from-fans/), for example. The sentiment seemed to be that he was an ok quarterback, but just ok. Fans wanted see if the freshman and 4-star recruit Ty Thompson could do any better. Was this criticism of Brown justified? Let's take a look.\n\nI'm going to need some data on Anthony Brown's performance, so let's see what we can get via the API. If we go to their [API docs](https://api.collegefootballdata.com/api/docs/?url=/api-docs.json#/) page, the **games/players/** data looks promising. To read the data into an R session, I'm going to use the `GET()` function from `httr` package. I want to grab all player data from the 2021 regular season for games in which a PAC-12 team played, so I need to build the URL accordingly. To do that, I add the base URL for the API, \"https://api.collegefootballdata.com/\". Then the data set \"games/players\". And then the filters \"?year=2021&seasonType=regular&conference=PAC\". To use the API, I need to request an API token and include the word \"Bearer\" followed by my token. I do that with the add_headers argument. Notice I stored by API token in my `.Renviron` file and retrieved it with `Sys.getenv()` so that my token isn't just printed in this post. So here we go.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(httr)\n\npac12 <- httr::GET(\n  url = \"https://api.collegefootballdata.com/games/players?year=2021&seasonType=regular&conference=PAC\", \n  httr::add_headers(\n    Authorization = paste(\"Bearer\", Sys.getenv(\"CFDB_API_TOKEN\"))\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nGreat! So What do I do with this thing? Well, I can check to see if I got an error or not from my request.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstatus_code(pac12)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 200\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA status code of 200 is good. 400 means there was an error of some kind. Maybe a typo in the URL, for example. Ok, but still. What is this `pac12` thing?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(pac12)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"response\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's not a data frame or JSON or some kind of data structure, it's a response object. So now I need to get it into a data structure. I can do that with the `content()` function from `httr`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npac12_parsed <- content(pac12, \"parsed\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nGreat! So NOW what do I have to work with?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(pac12_parsed)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"list\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA list. Specifically, it's JSON. Better, but still not what I want to work with. Turns out there are a number of packages and functions to work with JSON, and the first package I came across with the functions I'll need is `tidyr`. According to the docs, the idea is to \"rectangularize\" the JSON into a tibble, so the first step is to create a tibble with a single column named `data` and then begin un-nesting the tibble to get at the underlying data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\np12 <- tibble(data = pac12_parsed)\np12 <- p12 %>% unnest_auto(data)\nhead(p12)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"id\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"teams\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"list\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"401309888\",\"2\":\"<list [2]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309876\",\"2\":\"<list [2]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309875\",\"2\":\"<list [2]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309870\",\"2\":\"<list [2]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309873\",\"2\":\"<list [2]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309874\",\"2\":\"<list [2]>\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`unnest_auto` is handy when you don't know the JSON structure. In this case, it applied `unnest_wider()` to create a tibble with now two columns. We can see that the new column `teams` is a nested list, so now we need to un-nest that column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np12 <- p12 %>% unnest_auto(teams)\nhead(p12)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"id\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"teams\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"list\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"401309888\",\"2\":\"<named list [5]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309888\",\"2\":\"<named list [5]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309876\",\"2\":\"<named list [5]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309876\",\"2\":\"<named list [5]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309875\",\"2\":\"<named list [5]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309875\",\"2\":\"<named list [5]>\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOk, so it applied `unnest_longer()`, but `teams` is still a nested list - only now there are 5 things in the lists instead of 2, so I guess we need to keep at it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np12 <- p12 %>% unnest_auto(teams)\nhead(p12)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"id\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"school\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"conference\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"homeAway\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"points\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"categories\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"list\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"401309888\",\"2\":\"Utah\",\"3\":\"Pac-12\",\"4\":\"away\",\"5\":\"52\",\"6\":\"<list [9]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309888\",\"2\":\"Stanford\",\"3\":\"Pac-12\",\"4\":\"home\",\"5\":\"7\",\"6\":\"<list [8]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309876\",\"2\":\"Arizona State\",\"3\":\"Pac-12\",\"4\":\"away\",\"5\":\"21\",\"6\":\"<list [10]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309876\",\"2\":\"Utah\",\"3\":\"Pac-12\",\"4\":\"home\",\"5\":\"35\",\"6\":\"<list [8]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309875\",\"2\":\"Arizona\",\"3\":\"Pac-12\",\"4\":\"away\",\"5\":\"0\",\"6\":\"<list [7]>\"},{\"1\":\"401309875\",\"2\":\"Colorado\",\"3\":\"Pac-12\",\"4\":\"home\",\"5\":\"34\",\"6\":\"<list [8]>\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we're getting somewhere.

In other words, for each school, how long has their head coach been there? For that, I think I'll need to go back quite a few years to make sure I'm capturing coaches with a lot of tenure. To be safe, I want to go back 35 years to 1987.

The average coach tenure is only 5 years - half of what it used to be.\n\nAnother way of looking at this would be to think of it in terms of coach turnover per year.

Nah, leave that for another post.\n\n## Oregon Recruiting\n\nMario Cristobal is regarded as a great recruiter, which got me thinking. Since I have coach data going back a ways, let's see how Oregon recruiting has done over time. The API has information on recruiting, so I'll grab everything they have on high school players who committed to Oregon. The data contains the star rating for each recruit, and it also has something called a player's rating. I don't know how that's calculated, but it looks like it's a number between 0 and 1 with larger number indicating a higher caliber recruit. For this purpose, I think a continuous number like rating is better than a categorical \"star\" rating. I'll use that to plot the mean recruit rating over time and color the points according to the head coach.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrec <- httr::GET(\n  url = \"https://api.collegefootballdata.com/recruiting/players?classification=HighSchool&team=Oregon\", \n  httr::add_headers(\n    Authorization = paste(\"Bearer\", Sys.getenv(\"CFDB_API_TOKEN\"))\n  )\n)\n\ntibble(data = content(rec, \"parsed\")) %>% \n  unnest_wider(data) %>% \n  unnest_wider(hometownInfo) %>%\n  filter(year != 2001) %>%\n  mutate(latitude = as.numeric(latitude),\n         longitude = as.numeric(longitude),\n         year = year - 1) %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(mean_rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%\n  left_join(\n    cl %>% \n      filter(fbs_team == \"Oregon\") %>% \n      mutate(year = as.integer(year)\n             ), by = \"year\") %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(x=year, y=mean_rating, color=coach), size = 2) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x=year, y=mean_rating), method = \"lm\", formula = y~x) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Mean Recruit Rating\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you're a Ducks fan, that chart should make you happy. Mike Bellotti was a little shaky early on but got things off to a nice start. Chip Kelly was really consistent and above the overall trend. The fact that the Duck's did so well nationally during his time given his recruit ratings were less than 0.9 suggests he was able to make the most of the available talent. Things dropped off a bit with Mark Helfrich, and then there's Willie Taggart's one hit wonder. Mario got things back on track, and Dan Lanning's is certainly off to a great start.\n\nOk, so that's Oregon. It would be interesting to see how Oregon does compared to the rest of the teams. But instead of just a comparison of all the teams' ratings, the observation about Chip Kelly getting a lot of bang for the buck gave me an idea. How about a chart that, for a given year, has the recruit ratings on one axis and a team's win record on the other? That ought to highlight those teams that over and under perform given the talent on their roster.\n\n## Bang For The Buck Chart\n\nFor this chart, I'll take a different approach than I did for the last one. I'll start by getting each team's current roster, and then go back and get each player's recruit rating. This will account for players who transferred at some point. I'll also get all of the recruit sources, not just high school players. I'll also limit the chart to the 130 FBS teams. I'll then get each team's 2021 win-loss record, and combine it all together for the chart. I noticed that the FBS data set also contains team logos, so for some bling, I'll use team logos as markers. This takes a decent chunk of code, so here goes.
