## Welcome

This site contains R and Python scripts for data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and miscellaneous other projects. It's primarily meant to be a try things out and be a repository of useful tidbids of code.
:::

::: center-text
The blog posts are either R or Python scripts that cobble together code I either wrote myself or, as is often the case, borrowed from one of the many more talented people who are kind enough to share their knowledge. Be aware that *there could be errors* lurking about my scripts. If you find one, kindly leave a comment.
