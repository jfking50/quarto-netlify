I found that TriPeaks on master and grandmaster difficulty gave me more trouble than the others. You have to find just the right combination of *not* clearing cards from the board, and at times, it would take me an annoyingly long time to find that magical combination. As the brain fog cleared, I decided to write some code to take care of those pesky games, and this is it.\n\nTo address the elephant in the room: yes, this is completely cheating! On the other hand,\n\n::: {#fig-seth}\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/mJhRSYXxzq6CA0ldkh\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/)\n:::\n\nAnyway, the method I came up with requires me to input all of the cards manually, which means I have to at least expose all of the cards, write them all down, and type them into my console. The point is, this will solve a board, but it won't win any speed contests.\n\n## The Algorithm\n\nMy first thought about how to go about this was to try and keep track of all possible branches of possible moves and grind through them all until I found a solution. That seemed like a lot of work, so I thought about a different approach. As I clear a board the first time, I have a general strategy, but with the more difficult levels, I almost never clear the board on the first attempt. It feels a bit random about which cards to clear or leave on the board for later, so why not embrace the randomness? Instead of keeping track of all possible moves, I just randomly select among the available moves (including not making a move at all). Depending on the level of randomness, it turns out, this method can clear a board in 20 attempts, on average. A lot less than I expected!\n\nLet's get to it. The first thing we need are the cards, so I create two vectors: one for the stock cards at the bottom `stock`, and one for the main board `board_orig`. For the stock, I put the cards in order from top to bottom (or, from right to left based on the Microsoft Solitaire layout). For the board, I start at the lower left, and go left to right across the bottom row, then left to right across each successively higher row.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# right to left (i.e., top to bottom)\nstock <- c(3,9,12,2,2,8,3,10,11,10,6,13,7,12,11,12,1,11,5,8,6,3,6,11)\n\n# by row, starting at the lower left\nboard_orig <- c(\n  5, 9, 1, 2, 7, 4, 13, 9, 7, 3,\n  5, 6, 8, 7, 4, 9, 4, 13, 13, \n  2, 10, 12, 5, 8, 1, \n  1, 10, 4\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBefore I get to the main script, I wrote one function `get_viz_idx()` that takes the board vector as input and returns a vector of the board indices that are currently visible. As I mention below, when a card from the board is cleared, I replace it with a 0 in the `board` vector. I take advantage of that to determine what the remaining cards are. Then, starting with the bottom row, I see what cards remain in that row. Based on what remains in the bottom row, I can then determine what cards are visible in the next higher row. I apply that same logic to the 3rd and 4th rows and then return a vector containing the indices of visible cards.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_viz_idx <- function(bd){\n  remain <- bd != 0          # boolean for the remaining cards\n  r1 <- which(remain[1:10])  # indices of remaining bottom row (row 1) cards\n  r2 <- c()                  # second from bottom row, etc.\n  r3 <- c()\n  r4 <- c()\n  \n  r2_filter <- remain[1:10] # check row 1 to see what's visible in row 2\n  for (i in 1:(length(r2_filter)-1)){\n    if(!r2_filter[i] & !r2_filter[i+1] & remain[i+10] != 0){\n      r2 <- c(r2, i+10)}\n  }\n  r3_filter <- remain[11:19] # check row 2 to see what's visible in row 3\n  for (i in 1:(length(r3_filter)-1)){\n    if(!r3_filter[i] & !r3_filter[i+1] & remain[i+19] != 0 & i <= 2){\n      r3 <- c(r3, i+19)}\n    if(i == 3 | i == 6) next\n    if(!r3_filter[i] & !r3_filter[i+1] & remain[i+18] != 0 & (i == 4 | i == 5)){\n      r3 <- c(r3, i+18)}\n    if(!r3_filter[i] & !r3_filter[i+1] & remain[i+17] != 0 & i > 6){\n      r3 <- c(r3, i+17)}\n  }\n  r4_filter <- remain[20:25] # check row 3 to see what's visible in row 4\n  for (i in c(1,3,5)){\n    if(!r4_filter[i] & !r4_filter[i+1] & remain[i+25] != 0 & i == 1){\n      r4 <- c(r4, i+25)}\n    if(!r4_filter[i] & !r4_filter[i+1] & remain[i+24] != 0 & i == 3){\n      r4 <- c(r4, i+24)}\n    if(!r4_filter[i] & !r4_filter[i+1] & remain[i+23] != 0 & i == 5){\n      r4 <- c(r4, i+23)}\n  }\n  viz <- c(r1, r2, r3, r4) # combine indices of visible cards into one vector\n  viz\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor the main script, I put everything in a nested `while()` loop. Each pass through the outer loop is an attempt at solving the game. As I mentioned, when a card is cleared from the board, I change the card to a 0, so the loop keeps going as long as there are less than 28 zeros in the board vector. I also added a counter `count` to keep track of how many attempts have been made. If it reaches 1000, then I'm fairly certain the board is unsolvable, and the loop will stop.\n\nI keep track of a game's history with `history()`. If the next move is to remove a card from the stock, I add a 0. Otherwise, I add the index of the board vector cleared.\n\nThe inner loop will stop when there are no stock cards left, and the comments should explain the rest of the logic.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboard <- board_orig  # make a copy of the original board.\ncount <- 0           # attempt counter\n\nwhile (sum(board==0) != 28 & count <= 1000){\n  \n  board <- board_orig\n  history <- c()    # 0 if draw from stock, else index of board played\n  idx_played <- c() # helps keeps track of what cards are visible\n  stock_count <- 1  # the current stock card index  \n  card <- stock[stock_count] # the current card being considered for a move\n  \n  while(stock_count <= 24){\n    if(is.null(idx_played)){ # at the start of a game, \n      viz_idx <- 1:10        # the visible board indices are 1:10\n    }else{ # otherwise call a function to get the visible board indices\n        viz_idx <- get_viz_idx(board)\n        } \n    \n    # get indices for all valid moves\n    if (card == 1) {  # allows for wrap-aound if card is an Ace\n      poss_next <- \n        viz_idx[c(which(board[viz_idx] == card + 12), \n                  which(board[viz_idx] == card + 1))]}\n    if (card == 13) { # allows for wrap-aound if card is a King\n      poss_next <-\n        viz_idx[c(which(board[viz_idx] == card - 12), \n                  which(board[viz_idx] == card - 1))]}\n    if (card > 1 & card < 13) {\n      poss_next <- \n        viz_idx[c(which(board[viz_idx] == card - 1), \n                  which(board[viz_idx] == card + 1))]}\n    \n    # if no available card to remove or randomly choose not to clear it,\n    # then advance to next stock card\n    if (length(poss_next) == 0 | runif(1) > 0.99){ \n      stock_count <- stock_count + 1\n      history <- c(history, 0)\n      card <- stock[stock_count]\n    }else{\n      next_idx <- ifelse(length(poss_next) == 1, poss_next, sample(poss_next, 1))\n      idx_played <- c(idx_played, next_idx)\n      history <- c(history, next_idx)\n      card <- board[next_idx]\n      board[next_idx] <- 0\n    }\n  }\n  count <- count + 1\n}\n\nhistory\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  6 10  4  3  7  0 13  9  0 19  0  0  0  5  0 15  1  0  2  0  0  8  0 14  0\n[26] 22 18 25  0 12 11 17  0  0 21 16 24  0  0 20 26  0  0 28 23  0  0  0  0  0\n[51] 27  0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo there's a solution! Clear as mud, right? Recall that a 0 in `history` means that a stock card was played, so I can replace those with `stock` vector. If it's not a zero, it represents the index of the `board_orig` vector that was cleared. I need to put that all together and clean things up so I can make a clean visualization of how to win the game.\n\n## Results Cleanup\n\nI'm going to need some help from `dplyr` for data wrangling.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe first thing I'm going to do is make a dataframe `df` for the cleaned up results. The `card` column contains all of the cards from the `stock` and `board` vectors. The `pile` column just indicates which of the two vectors the card came from, and `index` is simple the indices of the original two vectors.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboard <- board_orig\n\ndf <- tibble(\n  card = c(stock, board),\n  pile = c(rep(\"stock\", length(stock)), rep(\"board\", length(board))),\n  index = c(1:24, 1:28)\n)\n\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"card\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"pile\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"index\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"3\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"1\"},{\"1\":\"9\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"2\"},{\"1\":\"12\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"3\"},{\"1\":\"2\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"4\"},{\"1\":\"2\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"5\"},{\"1\":\"8\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"6\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI then create a dataframe `h` to contain the `history` vector and which \"pile\", or vector, the `history` entry refers to. I replace all of the 0s (the `stock` cards) with the order in which they appeared in `stock`, and then I join the two dataframes together.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nh <- tibble(\n  index = history,\n  order = 1:52,\n  pile = ifelse(index == 0, \"stock\", \"board\")\n)\n\nh[h$index==0, \"index\"] <- 1:sum(h$index==0)\n\ndf <- df |> left_join(h, by = c(\"pile\", \"index\"))\n\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"card\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"pile\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"index\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"order\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"3\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"1\",\"4\":\"6\"},{\"1\":\"9\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"2\",\"4\":\"9\"},{\"1\":\"12\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"3\",\"4\":\"11\"},{\"1\":\"2\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"4\",\"4\":\"12\"},{\"1\":\"2\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"5\",\"4\":\"13\"},{\"1\":\"8\",\"2\":\"stock\",\"3\":\"6\",\"4\":\"15\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization\n\nWhat I want to visualize is something like the game itself, so I found some .png files for each of the cards.
