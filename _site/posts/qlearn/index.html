<p>I’ve been reading some books on machine learning, and recently started going through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</a> by Aurélien Géron. His chapter on reinforcement learning is great, and it inspired me to apply some of the methods on my own. I decided to start with the game of tic-tac-toe since it’s a little more complicated than a trivial simple example but not as complicated as chess or go.</p>
<section id="states-and-actions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="states-and-actions">States and Actions</h2>
<p>Q-Learning is a type of reinforcement learning that can be applied to situations where there are a discrete number of states and actions, but the transition probabilities between states are unknown. In the game of tic-tac-toe, the state is the game board, which consists of nine possible locations to play that are either empty, contain an X, or contain a O. I will represent the state as an array of length nine where 0 represents an empty space, 1 represents an X, and -1 represents an O. I’m defining things this way because eventually I want to apply deep Q learning to the same problem, and these will become inputs to a neural network. Anyway, at the beginning of the game, the board is empty, so it will be represented as:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="1">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>state <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="dv">0</span> <span class="cf">for</span> i <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="bu">range</span>(<span class="dv">9</span>)]</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>state</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="1">
<pre><code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the beginning of the game, there are nine possible actions for the first player (in this case, player X). An action of 0 represents X playing in the upper left board position, an action of 1 represents the upper middle position, etc. If X plays action 0, and O plays action 3, the state becomes:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="2">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>state[<span class="dv">0</span>] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span>   <span class="co"># X plays action 0</span></span>

<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="2">
<pre><code>[1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="rewards" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rewards">Rewards</h2>
<p>In all reinforcement learning techniques, a reward system is used. To develop a game playing policy for X, if an action results in X winning the game, the reward will be 1. If O wins, the reward will be -1. All other actions will have a reward of 0.</p>
</section>
<section id="q-values" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q-values">Q-Values</h2>
<p>In Q-Learning, state-action pairs <em>(s, a)</em> have an associated quality value <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> that are used to determine what the best move is for that state (the higher the Q-value, the better the move). When the algorithm begins and the first game is played, all Q-values are zero, so the AI (player X) is essentially playing randomly. Once the first game is played that is either a win or a loss, the first non-zero reward is given, and so the first non-zero Q-value is produced for the state-action pair that resulted in that reward. As the algorithm explores the state space, non-zero Q-values propagate back from the state-action pairs that won or lost the game to the state-action pairs that led up to the winning or losing move. In other words, the Q-values are slowly updated based on a running average of the reward <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> received when leaving a state <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> with an action <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> plus the sum of discounted future rewards it expects to get assuming optimal play from that point on and adjusted by a learning rate <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. To estimate the sum of the discounted future rewards, I take the maximum of the Q-value estimates for the next state <span class="math inline">\(s′\)</span>. That was a mouthful. Maybe in this case, math might be clearer than English:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Q\left(s, a\right) \xleftarrow[\alpha ]{} r \gamma\cdot \underset{a'}{max}Q\left(s', a'\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>That’s it. It ends up just being a big book-keeping exercise to keep track of a whole bunch of state-action pairs and their associated Q-values. To do that, I use a dictionary data structure with the state-action pair as the key and the Q-value as the value.</p>
</section>
<section id="epsilon-greedy-policy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="epsilon-greedy-policy">Epsilon-Greedy Policy</h2>
<p>I added an epsilon-greedy policy to encourage the algorithm to continue to explore the state-space throughout the training process. I implemented it in the following way. Before each action by X, I draw a random number and compare it to a variable represented by epsilon. If the random number is less than epsilon, then player X’s next action is random. Otherwise, player X’s next action is determined by the Q-values. When the algorithm starts, epsilon is 1.0. As training progresses, epsilon gradually decreases to 0.01.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-tic-tac-toe-environment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-tic-tac-toe-environment">The Tic-Tac-Toe Environment</h2>
<p>I set this all up in a{python} class called <code>env</code> with the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>reset</code> sets the state to represent an empty board (the start of a new game)</li>
<li><code>game_over</code> checks to see if the game is over, and if so, gives a reward for a win or loss</li>
<li><code>step</code> represents a single action either by player X or player O</li>
<li><code>train_q</code> implements the Q-learning algorithm</li>
</ul>
<p>After importing the usual suspects, I define the <code>env</code> class.</p>

<p>So here we go. I’ll have X play O before any Q-learning, update the Q-values based on 20,000 games, have X play O again, update Q-values some more, and so on for 10 iterations. By the end, the algorithm will have seen 200,000 games. Recall that the output is X wins, O wins, and ties and that X plays O 1,000 times, so move the decimal to the left once for the percent of wins.</p>

<p>Seems to be working nicely! X, the AI-enabled player, definitely improves over time. This shows all of the non-zero Q-values at the end of training. There are a little over 6,500 of them and most are positive, which suggests to me that the algorithm capitalizing on what it’s learned and back propagating Q-values. Since there are more positive Q-values than negative, it’s seeking out those positive rewards like it’s supposed to.</p>

<p>Anyone who has played tic-tac-toe more than a few times learns that the best opening move is to play in the center of the board. I was curious of the Q-leaning algorithm picked this up, so I looked up the Q-values for an empty board. The fifth value listed represents the center of the board, and it is in fact the greatest Q-value. Pretty cool!</p>

<span id="cb23-25"><a href="#cb23-25" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Q-Learning is a type of reinforcement learning that can be applied to situations where there are a discrete number of states and actions, but the transition probabilities between states are unknown. In the game of tic-tac-toe, the state is the game board, which consists of nine possible locations to play that are either empty, contain an X, or contain a O. I will represent the state as an array of length nine where 0 represents an empty space, 1 represents an X, and -1 represents an O. I'm defining things this way because eventually I want to apply deep Q learning to the same problem, and these will become inputs to a neural network. Anyway, at the beginning of the game, the board is empty, so it will be represented as:</span>

<span id="cb23-50"><a href="#cb23-50" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In Q-Learning, state-action pairs *(s, a)* have an associated quality value $Q$ that are used to determine what the best move is for that state (the higher the Q-value, the better the move). When the algorithm begins and the first game is played, all Q-values are zero, so the AI (player X) is essentially playing randomly. Once the first game is played that is either a win or a loss, the first non-zero reward is given, and so the first non-zero Q-value is produced for the state-action pair that resulted in that reward. As the algorithm explores the state space, non-zero Q-values propagate back from the state-action pairs that won or lost the game to the state-action pairs that led up to the winning or losing move. In other words, the Q-values are slowly updated based on a running average of the reward $r$ received when leaving a state $s$ with an action $a$ plus the sum of discounted future rewards it expects to get assuming optimal play from that point on and adjusted by a learning rate $\alpha$. To estimate the sum of the discounted future rewards, I take the maximum of the Q-value estimates for the next state $s′$. That was a mouthful. Maybe in this case, math might be clearer than English:</span>

<span id="cb23-56"><a href="#cb23-56" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>That's it. It ends up just being a big book-keeping exercise to keep track of a whole bunch of state-action pairs and their associated Q-values. To do that, I use a dictionary data structure with the state-action pair as the key and the Q-value as the value.</span>

<span id="cb23-60"><a href="#cb23-60" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I added an epsilon-greedy policy to encourage the algorithm to continue to explore the state-space throughout the training process. I implemented it in the following way. Before each action by X, I draw a random number and compare it to a variable represented by epsilon. If the random number is less than epsilon, then player X's next action is random. Otherwise, player X's next action is determined by the Q-values. When the algorithm starts, epsilon is 1.0. As training progresses, epsilon gradually decreases to 0.01.</span>

I'll have X play O before any Q-learning, update the Q-values based on 20,000 games, have X play O again, update Q-values some more, and so on for 10 iterations. By the end, the algorithm will have seen 200,000 games. Recall that the output is X wins, O wins, and ties and that X plays O 1,000 times, so move the decimal to the left once for the percent of wins.</span>

<span id="cb23-198"><a href="#cb23-198" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Seems to be working nicely! X, the AI-enabled player, definitely improves over time. This shows all of the non-zero Q-values at the end of training. There are a little over 6,500 of them and most are positive, which suggests to me that the algorithm capitalizing on what it's learned and back propagating Q-values. Since there are more positive Q-values than negative, it's seeking out those positive rewards like it's supposed to.</span>

I was curious of the Q-leaning algorithm picked this up, so I looked up the Q-values for an empty board. The fifth value listed represents the center of the board, and it is in fact the greatest Q-value. Pretty cool!</span>
